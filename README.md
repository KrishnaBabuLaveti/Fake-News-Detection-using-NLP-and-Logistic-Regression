# Fake-News-Detection-using-NLP-and-Logistic-Regression
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Logistic Regression. The model classifies news articles as real (0) or fake (1) based on their textual content.

Key Features

#Data Preprocessing

Merged author and title into a single text feature.

Removed special characters, converted text to lowercase, removed stopwords, and applied stemming.

#Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical feature vectors.

#Model Training

Applied Logistic Regression to train the classifier.

#Evaluation

Achieved high accuracy on both training and test datasets.

#Prediction System

Detects whether a given news article is real or fake in real time.

#Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy

NLTK (stopwords, stemming)

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF Vectorizer, train-test split, accuracy evaluation)
